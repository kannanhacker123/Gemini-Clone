# Gemini Clone (React)

This project is a simplified clone of the Gemini conversational AI interface, built using React. It demonstrates basic chat functionality, content processing (including code highlighting and math rendering), and a clean user interface.

    *   Mathematical expressions (using KaTeX)
    *   Code snippets (with syntax highlighting using Prism.js)
*   **Clean UI:** Modern and user-friendly interface.
*   **Security:** Uses DOMPurify to sanitize HTML content and prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
